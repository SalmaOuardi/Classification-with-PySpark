  Classification with Pyspark

In the course of this project, I successfully performed feature extraction from raw input data, and trained multiple classification models using the **Mllib library**. A comprehensive performance comparison was carried out among the models, in order to determine the most optimal model.

This project is inspired from the book [Machine Learning with Spark](https://k0d.cc/storage/books/Databases/Spark/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Spark.pdf)

#### Tasks / Achievements

* Used PySpark to extract the appropriate features from raw input data.
* Trained a number of classification models using MLlib.
* Made predictions with our classification models. 
* Applied a number of standard evaluation techniques to assess the predictive performance of our models.
* Explored the impact of parameter tuning on model performance and learn how to use cross-validation to select the most optimal model parameters.
